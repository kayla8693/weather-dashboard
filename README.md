# Weather Dashboard
A weather dashboard application which utilizes the Open Weather API to allow users to search for different cities and get live weather updates as well as 5-day forecasts.

The application uses AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format and display it to the user. Features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The application displays city, date, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for any given city, along with the current weather icon. It also displays temperature and humidity for the 5-day forecast.
