# Weather Dashboard
A weather dashboard application which utilizes the Open Weather API to allowa  user to search for different cities and get live weather updates as well as 5-day forcasts.

The application uses AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format and display it to the user. Features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The application displays city, date, current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for any given city, along with the current weather icon. It also displays temperature and humidity for the 5-day forecast.

The users searched cities are retained upon each new search, and results can be viewed again by clicking the city's button. The cities are also saved in local storage and rendered onto the page after a refresh.
